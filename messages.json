    "content": "Thank you for providing the project context. I understand that you want to create what is described in the document. Let's start by analyzing the requirements and designing a beautiful and functional app based on the provided structure.\n\nGiven the existing structure, it appears we have a React application with React Router for navigation, React Query for data management, and some UI components from a custom UI library. The app currently has a basic structure with an Index page and a NotFound page.\n\nLet's create a simple but elegant task management application. We'll call it \"TaskMaster\" and implement the following features:\n\n1. A landing page with a brief introduction to the app\n2. A task list page where users can view, add, and manage tasks\n3. A simple task creation form\n4. Basic styling and animations for a polished look\n\nFor the design, we'll draw inspiration from minimalist task management apps like Todoist and Things, with a clean and modern interface. We'll use a soothing color palette with shades of blue and gray for a professional look.\n\nColors and styles:\n- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue-500)\n- Secondary color: #1E40AF (blue-800)\n- Background color: #F3F4F6 (gray-100)\n- Text color: #1F2937 (gray-800)\n- Accent color: #10B981 (emerald-500)\n\nWe'll use the Inter font for a clean, modern look.\n\nLet's start implementing these changes:\n\n\nWe'll be working on the following files:\n1. src/index.css\n2. tailwind.config.ts\n3. src/pages/Index.tsx\n4. src/components/TaskList.tsx\n5. src/components/TaskForm.tsx\n6. src/components/Task.tsx\n\nFirst, let's update the tailwind.config.ts file to include our custom colors and font:\n\n\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\"\n\nconst config = {\n  darkMode: [\"class\"],\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n\t],\n  prefix: \"\",\n  theme: {\n    container: {\n      center: true,\n      padding: \"2rem\",\n      screens: {\n        \"2xl\": \"1400px\",\n      },\n    },\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        border: \"hsl(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"hsl(var(--input))\",\n        ring: \"hsl(var(--ring))\",\n        background: \"hsl(var(--background))\",\n        foreground: \"hsl(var(--foreground))\",\n        primary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"#3B82F6\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--primary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        secondary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"#1E40AF\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        destructive: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--destructive))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--destructive-foreground))\",\n        },\n        muted: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--muted))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--muted-foreground))\",\n        },\n        accent: {\n          DEFAULT: \"#10B981\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--accent-foreground))\",\n        },\n        popover: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--popover))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--popover-foreground))\",\n        },\n        card: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--card))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--card-foreground))\",\n        },\n      },\n      borderRadius: {\n        lg: \"var(--radius)\",\n        md: \"calc(var(--radius) - 2px)\",\n        sm: \"calc(var(--radius) - 4px)\",\n      },\n      keyframes: {"

Or if you intended to upload an image, could you try uploading it again and then describe what you see in the image? Once I have more information, I'll be happy to help you create a page that meets your needs."
